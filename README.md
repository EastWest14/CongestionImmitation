# Congestion Immitation
### DESCRIPTION:

A simple model of network congestion on a buffer. Packets arrive at a buffer randomly, at a given average rate. Buffer queues the packets and forwards them one by one.
As a result of the run we get statistical distribution - number of sent and received packets, maximum and average delay, queue size, etc.

INSTRUCTIONS:

./CompileRunAndTest.sh runs unit tests, a full system test and launches the immitation. Takes in 3 parameters: number of "ticks" in an immitation, number of sent packets and tick processing time on the buffer. 
Program provides a very simplistic immitation of congestion on an internet router.

NOTE:

Time is represented as a series of discrete "ticks_**".
